Getting Setup
=============

To start, we need to clone the files off of Github. In order to do that, install Git from one of the links below:

* `Git for Windows <https://git-scm.com/download/win>`_
* `Git for Mac <https://git-scm.com/download/mac>`_
* `Git for Linux <https://git-scm.com/download/linux>`_

Once Git is installed, we need to clone the GreenVision Repo. In order to do so, open git bash in whatever directory you
want to clone to and run the following::

    git clone https://github.com/TheGreenMachine/GreenVision.git

Next, you are going to want to install python if you haven't already. Download and install it from one of the links below. On Windows,
make sure to check the "Add to Path" checkbox and press "Disable Path Limit" after install:

* `Python 3.7.2 for Windows <https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.2/python-3.7.2.exe>`_
* `Python 3.7.2 for Mac <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/>`_
* `Python 3.7.2 for Linux <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/>`_

Once Python finishes installing, navigate to the GreenVision folder and run the following command to install the required libraries::

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

This will install all of the required packages. Once that's done, move on to the next step of the install in order to calibrate your camera.
