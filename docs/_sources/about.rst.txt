Hello, and Welcome to team 1816's Vision Code for the 2018-2019 Season. This year, we attempted to make our
code as transparent as possible, and in order to help other teams use or code, we created this documentation.
Our code this year is a one-file python program, with flags for various features, including:

* Image Capture
* Vision Processing
* Distance Recognition
* Yaw Determination
* And Video Capture

In order to get started using our code, click the Installation button on the side of the screen.
These docs will guide you from setup, to install, to usage, and will hopefully answer all of your questions.

Good Luck, and see you on the field!
