Usage
=====

Now that you've installed and setup everything, let's move on to how to actually use GreenVision. First things first,
that GreenVision is broken up into different categories:

* Vision Processing - This includes our actual robot image recognition code for the season.
* Image Capture - A utility to take pictures for calibration and off-robot use.
* Video Capture - A utility to take videos from the camera.
* Distance Table - A utility to log distance and contour area values in order to calibrate distance.

Since each of the categories has their own CLI flags, click on the links below to see info on each one.
